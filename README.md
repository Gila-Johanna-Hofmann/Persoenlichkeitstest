# Persoenlichkeitstest - personality test

## General info
The personality test was developed as a training project and a birthday present.
The personality test asks 13 questions and then gives an either-or-result: a user can be evaluated as either a or b. The default is b.
The project is set up as just one index page, which is sectioned in three parts. Two of the three parts are hidden depending on the actions taken by the user.
To the user, the project appears as a start page, the actual quiz page and then a third and last page with a result. The user navigates the "pages"/sections via buttons.
The project can be customized to any test that has an either-or outcome and the amount of questions and use of pictures can easily be customized.
